----------------------------------

Takes output from [Libre Hardware Monitor's][1] [built in HTTP server][2] and
converts it into [InfluxDB input line format][3].

I hook into Telegraf thusly:

    [[inputs.exec]]
      commands = [
         '''"C:\Program Files\Telegraf\libre-hardware-monitor-to-telegraf.exe"'''
      ]
      timeout = "5s"
      data_format = "influx"

    go build

## Cross Compiling
